Best Tips [link](https://timomak.github.io/SPD-1.01/#/)
 1. Restate the problem\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restate it in your own words to get a better understanding.
2. Ask clarifying questions\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay attention to subtle detail in the input or output. (common details are type, ordering, duplicates)
3. State your assumptions\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.x. input values cannot be modfied\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; order doesn't matter\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; input is unsorted\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there can be more assumptions later on in the code.
4. Think out loud\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep the interviewer updated!\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make sure they are following through so they can guide you as well.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuously talk throughout the process\
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.a Brain storm strategies\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk through code by hand which might make you figure out other algorithms and data structures.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use "I'm pretty sure it's". Don't sound too confident.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.b Explain your rational\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why you are using the algorithm you chose. Why use sort?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.c Discuss tradeoffs\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one solution might have a fast runtime but bad space complexity\
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.d Suggest improvements\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check each line of code to see if there can be smaller chages made to make it more efficient.
